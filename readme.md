# HEY! :3 
If you're here then you're probably looking for a functional version of the voxel project but in Rust.  
You aren't going to find it here! (sorry)

## So what is this?
Well, it's the Rust rewrite! 

Just... 

It'll become the main branch when the rust version matches the current C++ version and the C++ will get a new branch.  
So you won't actually find an up-to-date version of the project here. 

## Why ?
On a cold February night, I sat looking at my monitor and tried to find an idea for a project that could be written in Rust. 
I could have just started a new project, maybe done something with Rocket.rs or created a terminal application, but I just don't have the motiviation to do something when it isn't a thing that either: helps me, or provides fun.  
Then I remembered that I have a C++ project that fulfilled the following requirements: 
- I have lost motivation for it 
- Not Rust
- Used the same dependencies (I didn't want to re-learn everything)
- Would require multi-threading (I didn't want to learn thread safety :3)

So I decided that this would be the best choice!

# Build 
Should just be the typical method of building a Rust project 
```bash
cargo run 
```
# Run
Similar to building, it should be the typical method of running a Rust project 
```bash 
cargo build
```
